Project Overview

Emotion Recognition is a process of identifying human emotions from facial expressions.
This project uses images/video input to detect faces and classify the emotion displayed.

🎯 Features

Detects human faces from images or live camera

Recognizes emotions from facial expressions

Supports multiple emotion classes

Real-time emotion prediction (if webcam is used)

Beginner-friendly implementation

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python / Java (edit if needed)

Libraries & Tools:

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Haar Cascade / CNN

IDE: VS Code / PyCharm / Eclipse

📂 Dataset

Uses a facial emotion dataset (FER-2013 / custom dataset)

Images are labeled with different emotion classes

Dataset is used for training and testing the model

▶️ How It Works

Capture image/video input
